    C++ STL is divided into several components:
    1. Containers: These are data structures that store collections of objects. Examples include:
       - Sequence containers: vector, deque, list
       - Associative containers: set, multiset, map, multimap
       - Unordered associative containers: unordered_set,  unordered_multiset, unordered_map, unordered_multimap
       - Container adaptors: stack, queue, priority_queue
    
    2. Algorithms: These are functions that operate on containers, such as sorting, searching, and manipulating data. Examples include:
       - Sorting algorithms: sort, stable_sort, partial_sort
       - Searching algorithms: find, binary_search, lower_bound, upper_bound
       - Manipulation algorithms: reverse, rotate, shuffle
    
    3. Iterators: These are objects that allow traversal of containers. They provide a way to access elements in a container without exposing the underlying structure. Examples include:
       - Input iterators: allow reading elements from a container
       - Output iterators: allow writing elements to a container
       - Forward iterators: allow reading and writing elements in a single pass
       - Bidirectional iterators: allow moving both forward and backward
       - Random access iterators: allow jumping to any element in constant time
    
    4. Function objects: These are objects that can be called as functions. They are often used with algorithms to define custom behavior. Examples include:
       - Function pointers: pointers to functions
       - Functors: objects that overload the function call operator
       - Lambda expressions: anonymous functions defined inline
